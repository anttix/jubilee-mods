## MGN12H blocks on Z for [Jubilee](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee)

This may be helpful for folks who already have left-over Z-rails from another project (e.g. railcore) and
can not find MGN12C blocks that fit. Blocks from one cheap rail manufacturer often do not fit rails from another
manufacturer.

This mod enables use of the larger MGN12H blocks on **Z axis only** you still need more compact MGN12C blocks
for other axes.

When using this mod, make sure to mount rails 3mm higher on your Z extrusion than specified in Jubilee's assembly
manual. Unlike the original design, modified Z couplers are slightly smaller than the block.
