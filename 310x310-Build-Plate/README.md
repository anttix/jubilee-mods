## 310x310mm build plate for [Jubilee](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee)

Jubilee's aluminium plate has an area of 305x305mm. However some popular oriental printers use 310x310mm
making parts of that size more abundant and cheaper to obtain. 

This mod is helpful for cheapskates who mill their own build plate and are looking to use cheaper parts.

* Makes it possible to use cheap 310x310mm silicone heater pads 
* Makes it easier to use 310x310mm build sheets. Note that these sheets work fine on a standard plate and
  a larger magnetic sticker is not required. I recommend to order the official plate and a high temperature
  magnetic sticker to go with it, it's always nice to have an extra plate.

### How it works?

This mod pushes the sides of the cast aluminium plate out by 2.5mm. That's it! Kinetic ball locations
remain exactly the same and **there is no increase in usable build area**. Besides slightly larger mass,
there are no downsides to doing this **given you mill your own plate**.
